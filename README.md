# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-DL-

The MNIST dataset, short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset, comprises 60,000 small square grayscale images. These images are 28Ã—28 pixels and depict handwritten single digits ranging from 0 to 9. The goal is to categorize a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes, each corresponding to integer values from 0 to 9. It can be simply imported from Keras Datasets using from keras.datasets import mnist

Steps to run the code:
Run the Jupyter Notebook named as MNIST_DigitRecognition_UsingCNN.ipynb
Save the weight as mnist.h5

Results:
test_loss 0.0655471533536911
test_accuracy 0.9854999780654907
